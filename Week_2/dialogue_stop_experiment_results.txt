Assistant Output:
A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a type of neural network specifically designed to work with graph-structured data. Graphs are mathematical structures consisting of nodes (or vertices) and edges (connections between nodes), which can represent various types of relationships and interactions in data. GNNs are particularly useful for tasks where the data can be represented as graphs, such as social networks, molecular structures, recommendation systems, and knowledge graphs.

Key features of GNNs include:

1. **Node Representation**: GNNs learn representations (embeddings) for each node in the graph based on its features and the features of its neighbors. This allows the model to capture the local structure of the graph.

2. **Message Passing**: GNN

Assistant Output:
A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a type of neural network designed to process data structured as graphs. Graphs consist of nodes (or vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes. This structure allows GNNs to effectively capture relationships and interactions between entities represented as nodes.

Key features of GNNs include:

1. **Node Representation**: GNNs learn representations (or embeddings) for each node based on its features and the features of its neighboring nodes. This is done through a process known as message passing, where nodes exchange information with their neighbors.

2. **Propagation Mechanism**: GNNs typically operate through multiple layers, where each layer aggregates information from a node's neighbors, updating the node's representation iteratively

Assistant Output:
A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a type of neural network designed to work directly with graph-structured data. Graphs are data structures consisting of nodes (or vertices) and edges (connections between nodes), making them suitable for representing a variety of relational data, such as social networks, molecular structures, recommendation systems, and many other applications.

Key characteristics of GNNs include:

1. **Message Passing**: GNNs operate by passing messages between nodes. Each node aggregates information from its neighbors to update its representation. This can involve multiple iterations of message passing to allow for information to propagate across the graph.

2. **Node and Edge Features**: GNNs can incorporate features associated with the nodes and edges, allowing them to
